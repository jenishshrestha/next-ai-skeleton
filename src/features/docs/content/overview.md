## Core Philosophy

This skeleton is built for high-velocity engineering teams. It enforces strict architectural layering, performance-first runtime (Bun), and AI-native collaboration through pre-defined workspace skills.

## Tech Stack

| Component         | Technology            | Purpose                                      |
| :---------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Runtime**       | Bun                   | Ultra-fast package management & test runner  |
| **Framework**     | Next.js 16 (App)      | Modern React server components & routing     |
| **Styling**       | Tailwind CSS 4        | High-performance utility-first CSS           |
| **UI Library**    | Shadcn/UI             | Decoupled, accessible component architecture |
| **Data Fetching** | Axios + Server Action | Type-safe Data Access Layer (DAL)            |

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed globally.

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Development

Start the local development server with hot reloading.

```bash
bun dev
```

### 3. Verification

Run the technical suite to ensure everything is within standards.

```bash
bun test        # Run unit tests
bun run lint    # Run ESLint & Prettier
bun run typecheck # Run TypeScript compiler (noEmit)
```

## Key Differentiators

1.  **Feature-Driven Isolation**: Zero-leakage between features.
2.  **DAL Zero-Throw Policy**: Standardized API responses that never crash.
3.  **Agent-Native Intelligence**: Symlinked skills that "train" its AI agent.
4.  **Husky Hardened**: Strict Git hooks for branch naming and commit messages.
